# Stranger Things Code Challenge

To view my answer of the re-formated JSON data run `node server.js` in the console. The answer should be served on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Test

To run tests simply run `npm install ; npm test` in your console, or if you have installed dependancies already just run `npm test`.

Thanks!
