# Stranger Things Code Challenge

<!-- To view my answer of the re-formated JSON data run `node server.js` in the console. The answer should be served on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). -->
To view my answers of the re-formated JSON data run `node starngerThings.js`. The answer should appear in the console.

### Test

To run tests simply run `npm install ; npm test` in your console, or if you have installed dependancies already just run `npm test`.

Thanks!

## Things that I would continue to workon

- Get the data properly returning from the API, not sure why the API is sensitive from one device to another.
- Finish setting up the server.js file to return the cleaned data in a JSON object when the server is running.
- Furhter implament/fix tests for all functionality to some degree.
- learn how to format EPOCH time correctly.
